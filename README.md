## Tic tac toe game


This is a tic tae toe game created using html, css and javascript

I did this code in visual studios using the template ASP.NET core empty. I took visual studios as a html editor.

The main set up of this project would be to save the file and then open the saved file in any browser, this would lead you to my tic tac toe game website.
